# caps-cloud
I designed an application that uses real time messaging to allow vendors to notify drivers when packages are ready to be picked up. After drivers are notified, the drivers will pick up the package and deliver the package and consequently notify the vedors that the package was delivered.

## Challenge 
Using only AWS Services: SQS, SNS, Lambda, create a cloud version of the CAPS system.
